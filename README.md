# GlimmerGlass L1 Shell
This Shell supports L1 connectivity in CloudShell based on GlimmerGlass L1 Switch.

A CloudShell Shell implements integration of a device model, application or other technology with CloudShell. A Shell consists of a data-model that defines how the device and its properties are modeled in CloudShell along with an automation that enables interaction with the device via CloudShell.

This L1 shell provides connectivity (mapping) and management capabilities such as structure discovery and configuration of port settings.
